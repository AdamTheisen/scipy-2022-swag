- name: Py-ART
  desc: |+
    Collection of weather radar algorithms
    and utilities. Py-ART is used by the 
    Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) 
    User Facility for working with data from 
    its scanning radars as well as a broad 
    range of non-ARM radars.

- name: RadTraQ
  desc: |+
    RadTraQ is a python library in development
    for assessing and monitoring a radar's 
    quality and calibration.

    Currently includes functions for corner
    reflector analysis, cloud masks, profile
    comparisons, and more.

- name: PySP2
  desc: |+
    PySP2 is a python package for processing
    and visualizing SP2 data. PySP2 currently
    supports processing all raw SP2 data 
    (.sp2b, .hk, .ini) files into mass and 
    number size distributions.

#    Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor
#    
#    The aerosol chemical speciation 
#    monitor is a thermal vaporization,
#    electron impact, ionization mass
#    spectrometer.
#- name: CCN
#  desc: |+
#    Cloud Condensation Nuclei
#    Particle Counter
#    
#    The CCN measures the concentration
#    of aerosol particles by drawing an
#    air sample through a column with
#    thermodynamically unstable
#    supersaturated water vapor that
#    can condense onto aerosol particles.

#- name: KAZRARSCL 
#  desc: |+
#    Active Remote Sensing of Clouds
#    Using Ka-Band ARM Zenith Radar
#
#    KAZRARSCL is a core ARM VAP which
#    provides time vs. height information
#    on lowest cloud base and cloud 
#    boundaries for up to 10 cloud layers.
